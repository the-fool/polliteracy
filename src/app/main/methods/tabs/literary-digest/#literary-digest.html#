	  Our objective is to ask: <strong>are big polls always good polls?</strong>
	  To ask this question, let's explore a famous story about a <em>very</em>
	  large poll.
	</p>
	<p>
          In the presidential election of 1936, the incumbent Franklin Delano Roosevelt
          was challenged by the Republican governor Alfred Landon.  At that time,
          a popular magazine <em>The Literary Digest</em> decided to conduct a
	  national poll to predict the outcome of the election.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <em>The Literary Digest</em> was able
	  to poll <strong>eleven-million people</strong>!
	  It had gathered this list of people through collecting their information from:
	  <ul>
	    <li>
              Phonebooks
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Magazine subscriptions
	    </li>
	    <li>Automobile registrations</li>
	    <li>Club roster lists</li>
	  </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          And so the magazine mailed out 11,000,000 questionnaires to people.
	  They asked them to indicate who they would vote for, and then mail
	  it back.
        </p>
	<p>
	  Of course,
          many people did not bother the trouble or the postage to return their
          survey -- but those who did numbered over <strong>2,300,000!</strong>
	  This poll became
          one of the largest in history.
