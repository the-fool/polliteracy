          The problem with <em>The Literary Digest</em> was that their poll was
          biased in favor of wealthy, educated citizens (remember, they got their
          list of potential subjects from car registration forms and telephone
          directories).  Their actual sample was mainly composed of people from a
	  select demographic.
        <p>
          Even though their <em>sample size</em> was humongous, their poll was biased
          enough to under-represent the amount of pro-Roosevelt sentiment in the
          poorer segments of the United States.
	  Their poll was not <strong>random</strong>, and so they made their prediction
	  on an unfair, or biased, slice of American voters.

              The best answer, out of the options provided, is to call phone numbers
	      selected at random.  Now, each of these options are biased in their own
	      ways, but scientists generally agree that random dialing is yet the
	      least biased of the bunch.

	      First, interviewing random pedestrians at public places limits the sample
	      to those kinds of people which have a reason to be out walking at that
	      place.  Second, mailboxes may be more universal than telephones, but
	      the problem is that only certain sorts of people decide to put in the
	      effort to return mailed questionnaires. Lastly, an online survey
	      is restricted to those who visit the websites in question, which is a
	      small segment of the portion of the population that surfs the Web.
