          In the presidential election of 1936, the incumbent Franklin Delano Roosevelt
          was challenged by the Republican governor Alfred Landon.  At that time,
          a popular magazine <em>The Literary Digest</em> had the reputation of
          conducting large-scale public opinion polls.  Over the years it had put
          together a list of people to poll through collecting information from
          phonebooks, magazine subscriptions, automobile registrations, and
          various club roster lists.
          By the time <em>The Literary Digest</em> was ready to poll the nation about the
          1936 election, its list of contact information exceeded <strong>eleven-million</strong>
          entries!
        </p>
        <p>
          And so the magazine mailed its 11,000,000 questionnaires around the
          country.  Everyone who received this in the mail was asked to mark
          their intention to vote for either Roosevelt or Landon, and then mail
          it back to <em>The Literary Digest</em> headquarters. As you would guess,
          many people did not bother the trouble or the postage to return their
          survey -- but those who did numbered over 2,300,000!  This poll became
          one of the largest in history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results were published a month before the election:
	  <strong>Landon would win
          with 57% of the popular vote and an electoral college haul of 370 to 161.</strong>
          Due to the stupendously large sample size of their poll, <em>The Literary
          Digest</em> firmly believed that their poll wan confident to
          within a fraction of 1% of the true population opinion.

          Even if you didn't know this chapter in American history, I bet you
          figured <em>The Literary Digest</em> is not the success of this story.
          As a matter of fact, Roosevelt <em>won</em> the popular vote with 61%,
          and swept
          the electoral college <strong>523 to 8</strong>.
          This result differed by about 17% from
          the magazine's final prediction (not to mention how tight they calculated
          their confidence interval to be).
        </p>
        <p>
	  <strong>
	    With 2,300,000 poll results, <em>Literary Digest</em> predicted that
	    Lanond would win with an electoral college vote of 370 to 161.  The actual
	    vote is below, where you can see Landon only receievd 8 votes.
