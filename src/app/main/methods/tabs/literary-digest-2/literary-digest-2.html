	  <em>The Literary Digest</em> published their results:
	  <strong>
	    Landon would win with 57% of
	    the popular vote and an electoral college haul of 370 to 161.
	  </strong>
	</p>
          Due to the stupendously large sample size of their poll, <em>The Literary
          Digest</em> firmly believed that their poll would be correct.

          As a matter of fact, Roosevelt <em>won</em> the popular vote with 61%,
          and swept
          the electoral college <strong>523 to 8</strong>.
          This result differed by about 17% from
          the magazine's final prediction.

	  <strong>
	    With 2,300,000 poll results, <em>Literary Digest</em> predicted that
	    Lanond would win with an electoral college vote of 370 to 161.  The actual
	    vote is below, where you can see Landon only receievd 8 votes.
