          Was it just bad luck that <em>The Literary Digest</em> predicted
          extremely inaccurate results?  Sometimes it is just a matter of luck --
          but not so here.  The reason <em>The Literary Digest</em> was wrong
          is that same for why Gallup's poll was correct.  The issue at stake here
          is what we term <strong>sample bias</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sample is biased if it leans in one direction, favoring certain results,
          rather than representing a genuinely <em>random</em> (or unbiased)
          segment of the population.  If a poll sample only gets responses
          from a specific <strong>type</strong> of member of some population,
          it does not matter whether the sample size is one-thousand or one-million
          -- in either case the sample will be unrepresentative of the population
          as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem with <em>The Literary Digest</em> was that their poll was
          biased in favor of wealthy, educated citizens (remember, they got their
          list of potential subjects from car registration forms and telephone
          directories).  Their actual sample was mainly composed of people who met
          at least some of the following criteria:
          <ul>
            <li>Owned a registered automobile</li>
            <li>Owned a telephone line</li>
            <li>Subscribed to magazines</li>
            <li>Paid dues as a member of certain elite clubs</li>
            <li>Possessed the time, incentive, and money to mail back a questionnaire</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though their <em>sample size</em> was humongous, their poll was biased
          enough to under-represent the amount of pro-Roosevelt sentiment in the
          poorer segments of the United States.

              Imagine you have a large sack of beans.  You scoop out a handful
              and find that they are all black.  Then you scoop out two handfuls
              and see that <em>they</em> are all black, too.  The next three
              handfuls are all black again.  Do you see any reason to continue
              counting beans?
            </p>
            <p>
              But what if I told you that you were only scooping out beans from
              the <strong>top</strong> of the bag?  And at the bottom, most of the
              settled beans are red.  In this case, your sample size was large,
              but it was <strong>biased</strong>.
