          Even if you didn't know this chapter in American history, I bet you
          figured <em>The Literary Digest</em> is not the success of this story.
          As a matter of fact, Roosevelt <em>won</em> the popular vote with 61%,
          and swept
          the electoral college <strong>523 to 8</strong>.
          This result differed by about 17% from
          the magazine's final prediction (not to mention how tight they calculated
          their confidence interval to be).
        </p>
        <p>
	  <strong>
	    With 2,300,000 poll results, <em>Literary Digest</em> predicted that
	    Lanond would win with an electoral college vote of 370 to 161.  The actual
	    vote is below, where you can see Landon only receievd 8 votes.

          While printed questionnaires were being mailed back and forth by the
          <em>The Literary Digest</em>, another pollster was attempting to predict
          the election with a sample of about fifty-thousand people.  This man
          was George Gallup.  Where <em>The Literary Digest</em> failed with
          two-million responses to its poll, Gallup succeed with roughly 0.025%
          of their sample size!

              Imagine you have a large sack of beans.  You scoop out a handful
              and find that they are all black.  Then you scoop out two handfuls
              and see that <em>they</em> are all black, too.  The next three
              handfuls are all black again.  Do you see any reason to continue
              counting beans?  It seems highly unlikely that an further increase
              in sample size will tell you something you don't already know.
            </p>
            <p>
              But what if I told you that you were only scooping out beans from
              the <strong>top</strong> of the bag?  And at the bottom, most of the
              settled beans are red.  In this case, your sample size was large,
              but it was <strong>biased</strong>.  <em>This</em> problem with
              sample bias is what doomed <em>The Literary Digest</em>.
