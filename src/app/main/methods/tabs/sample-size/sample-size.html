	  When we poll, we are interested in knowing the true situation
	  for an entire group. 
	  It is usually not possible to ask <em>everyone</em> in a
          large group for their opinion on an issue.  
          If wee did, then we would know the exact statistical
          facts for the entire <strong>population</strong>.  We would not be mistaken,
          since we did not leave anyone out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, since it's not feasible to poll
          an entire population, we try to find ways to get a reasonably good
          guess about the entire group from polling a small portion of them.
          This piece of the population that actually gets polled is called
          the <strong>sample</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
          One goal of the scientists who make polls is then to get the most
          accurate information about a population without needing to poll
          an impractically large sample of the population.

          If we only poll a subset of a population, there is a chance
          that we missed some crucial information.  Our
          poll could be wrong! How should we
          minimize the chance for error?
        </p>
        <p>
          One simple fix is to <em>increase the sample size!</em>
          But then we need to ask ourselves: how big is big enough?
          It costs time and money to poll people! So we hope to strike
          a balance between the costs of sampling a large amount of people
          and the better accuracy with our poll results.
        </p>
        <p>
          This balance is a very important question, and it has been subject
          to a whole field of research. Today, scientists have reached a
          consensus on how large a sample size
          needs to be in order to be a reasonably good representation of the
          population.  It turns out, a sample less than 1000 can be good for
	  all of the USA!
