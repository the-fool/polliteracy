          Here is a second distribution of dots, whose true red-to-blue proprortion
	  is still 1/1 (100%).  However,
	  <strong>their distribution is not random</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Notice that you need a <em>special technique</em> with your sampling in
	  order to make your sample in such a way as to get near the true
	  ratio of the population (100%).
        </p>
	<p>
	  Instructions:
	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      Begin with drawing a random rectangle across the dots
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Click and drag the rectangle, making numerous additional samples
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Note how your sample's accuracy varies wildly depending on where in
	      the population you make your sample
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Observe that your sample is <strong>not random</strong>.  The colors
	      are <em>clustered</em>, and a rectangle only captures nearby neighbors
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Try to develop a sampling technique (drawing a rectangle) that
	      accounts for the clustering of colors, and thus achieves an accurate
	      sample (hint: symmetry is important)
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Success!  You now have a hands-on experience with <em>biased</em>
	      sampling methods!
	    </li>

          Notice how much more difficult it is to find a sample which gets near the true
	  100% ration of blue to red?  This is because our sampling method -- drawing
	  a rectangle -- is ill-suited to the task of randomly selecting these dots.
	</p>
	<p>
	  It is ill-suited because it only samples dots which are near enough to each
	  other to be within the boundaries of the rectangle.  Now, in the previous
	  example, the dots were randomly distributed throughout the field, and so
	  drawing a rectangle was a perfectly fine approach.  But this time, the dots
	  are skewed horizontally, with more red dots to the right and more blue to
	  the left.  
        </p>
        <p>
	  Due to this grouping-up of different kinds of dots, we need to adjust our
	  methods if we ever hope to catch a representative sample.
        </p>
        <p>
	  Let this serve as a demonstration for how polling methods can significantly
	  impact their results!
