	  In this lab we will experiment with the relationship between sample size,
	  sample randomness, and its accuracy with respect to the true population.
	  We saw in the previous case-studies that large polls have been wrong since they
	  were biased, and small polls could be trusted because they were sufficiently
	  random (remember, "random" is another way of saying "fair").  And now
	  we are going to see this principle in action with an interactive experiment.

	  In the <strong>first experiment</strong>, you wil take random samples of any size you choose.  Notice that after your sample size grows past a
	  certain threshold it becomes increasingly rare that your results are far off from
	  the true population ratio.

          In the <strong>second experiment</strong>, you will be confronted with
	  a <strong>biased</strong> polling method.  You can no longer take it for
	  granted that your sample is random.  Hence, it will be tricky to adjust
	  your polling technique in such a way as to capture an accurate slice
	  of the population.  This will serve as an example for how pollsters
