          What we see with this exercise is an application of the <strong>central limit theorem</strong>.
          This theorem is what lies behind the famous "bell-curve" of statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          It sounds like a mouthful, but it is basically the obvious assertion that with larger and larger
          sample sizes from the same population, the characteristics of these samples convere on a "central"
          point.  Each sample can be slightly different from each other, but as they get larger these differences
          start to vanish.  Hence, there is a "limit" at which those differences finally go down to zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can experiment with this by making a large box and dragging it around.  Notice that the ratio
          hardly changes at all with each new sample!
