          Below is a <em>random</em> scattering of two kinds of dots -- red and blue.
          The true <strong>population proportion</strong> between the two is
          1/1 (which would appear as 100%).
        </p>
	<p>
	  This is an experimental lab.  The point is to make random samples,
	  and see what results
	  you get!  <strong>Do not try to force your sample to be perfect -- it is
	    supposed to random, as if you were blind!</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Instructions:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Click and drag a random rectangle.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    This is your sample. Notice the <strong>size</strong> and its
	    sampled <strong>accuracy</strong> (perfectly
	    accurate samples have a reb-blue ratio at 100%)
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Drag the rectangle around the population, making many
	    random samples as you do
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Notice that most random samples stay fairly accurate (near 100%)
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Now experiment with different sample sizes -- notice that small samples
	    can be quite accurate by chance!  And notice that large samples are not
	    much more accurate than small samples!
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Try to make your sample extremely wrong -- notice how difficult it is!
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Success!  You now have an intuitive sense for why <strong>random sampling
	      is accurate even with small sample sizes</strong>
	  </li>

          What we see with this exercise is an application of the <strong>central limit theorem</strong>.
          This theorem is what lies behind the famous "bell-curve" of statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is basically the obvious assertion that with larger and larger
          sample sizes from the same population, the characteristics of these samples convere on a "central"
          point.  Each sample can be slightly different from each other, but as they get larger these differences
          start to vanish.  Hence, there is a "limit" at which those differences finally go down to zero.  The "limit" here at the center is a perfect ratio of 1/1 (100%).
        </p>
        <p>
          You can experiment with this by making a large box and dragging it around.  Notice that the ratio
          hardly changes at all with each new sample!
