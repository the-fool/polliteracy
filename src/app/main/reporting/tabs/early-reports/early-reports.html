          Over the years since the fiasco with <em>The Literary Digest</em>, polling
	  methodology has gotten better and better.  With this increase in our
	  skill at conducting polls comes an ability to forecast the likely
	  outcome of events before they run their full course.  It is now a
	  commonplace that large news organizations <strong>forecast</strong> the
	  end result of a presidential race, well before most votes have been counted. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Pollsters may predict the final outcome ahead of time with a variety of
	  tools and techniques.  One, which we have already seen, is the probability that
	  a small sample, if it is sufficiently random, will be near the truth.
	  Sometimes, the way they gather their sample on the day of an election is
	  through a process called <strong>exit polling</strong>.  This is so-named
	  because the sample is collected from people as the <em>exit</em> their
	  polling booths.

	  What effect could this ability to predict elections have on our political
	  process?  It is exciting to get early predictions -- but the early
	  forecasts can also cause problems for the voters.  Imagine that you are
	  waiting in line to cast your vote, and then you see on your phone that
	  your favored candidate has <em>already "lost"</em> according to the exit-polls.
	  Would you stay in line and cast your vote anyway?
        </p>

          One of the most dramatic incidents of this early forecasting in
	  the presidential race was in the 1980 contest between Reagan and Carter.
	  NBC News predicted Reagan's victory at <strong>8:15pm EST</strong>, well before
	  the West Coast polling stations even closed for the day!  This was the
	  earliest forecast ever, and this incident sent a shockwave through the media.
	  Nowadays, news stations make a promise not to call a winner <em>before</em>
	  voting officially ends, since they do not want to depress voter turnout.

              There is no right or wrong answer to this question, and indeed there have
	      been many lawsuits from both sides of the issue.  On the one hand,
	      people should have a right to broadcast facts, but on the other hand,
	      people should be able to vote in an undisturbed environment.  The
	      difficulty with resolving this issue
	      seems to stem from the way in which voting is a deeply private affair,
	      while polling is a purely public act.
