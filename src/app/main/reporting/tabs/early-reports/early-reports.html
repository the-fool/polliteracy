          Over the years since the fiasco with <em>The Literary Digest</em>, polling
	  methodology has gotten better and better.  With this increase in our
	  skill at conducting polls comes an ability to forecast the likely
	  outcome of events before they run their full course.  It is now a
	  commonplace that large news organizations <strong>forecast</strong> the
	  end result of a presidential race, well before most votes have been counted. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Pollsters may predict the final outcome ahead of time with a variety of
	  tools and techniques.  One, which we have already seen, is the probability that
	  a small sample, if it is sufficiently random, will be near the truth.
	  Sometimes, the way they gather their sample on the day of an election is
	  through a process called <strong>exit polling</strong>.  This is so-named
	  because the sample is collected from people as the <em>exit</em> their
	  polling booths.
