	  Perhaps the most famous book on statistics for the layperson is
	  Darrell Huff's 1954 read, <em>How to Lie with Statistics</em>.
	  The book was so-named due to the plentiful techniques the media has
	  to distort, confuse, or otherwise mislead their audience with the use of
	  true stastical data.
        </p>
        <p>
	  The media can lie <strong>with</strong> statistics by presenting
	  polling data in a way that seems to indicate false conclusions.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
	  One of the most popular (and most simple) way to skew the significance of
	  statistical findings is to present them in a graphical format with an
	  unreasonable y-axis.  By fiddling with the y-axis, news reporters can make
	  the significant difference between two statistics <strong>appear</strong>
	  to be greater, or lesser, depending on where they place the base of the
	  y-axis. 
        </p>
	<p>
	  Take a look at this image from Fox News:
	</p>
	  <img src="assets/images/etc/bush-expire.jpg" />
	 <p>
	<strong>
	  Does the difference between 35% and 39.6% seem larger than it should be?
	</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
	  The issue is that the <strong>y-axis</strong> is too high, which gives
	  the impression that the <strong>relative difference</strong> between these
	  two bars is greater than it actualy is.  A correct graph would look like this:

	  The <strong>y-axis</strong> is often referred to as the <strong>dependent
	  </strong> variable in a formula.  It is that which is <em>explained</em>
	  by the x-axis, or <strong>independent</strong> variable.
	  Shrinking the x-axis usually does not matter so much, because the x-axis
	  is meant to categorize the real focus of our attention: the y-axis variable.
