	  Polls and reports about polls are not the same.  Nor do they exist for the
	  same reasons.  Polls are conducted to gather certain facts, while reporting
	  must package and present information for a certain audience.  If the audience
	  does not have a strong scientific background, then reports on polls might
	  choose to downsplay subtle points of political science in favor of simplistic
	  or sensational assertions.  There is good and bad mixed in with this situation,
	  but in either case it means we must be careful when we read reports
	  about polls.

	  What we can say is that news organizations have <strong>special
	    interests</strong>.  This means that they are interested in a subset of
	  the whole <em>general</em> state-of-affairs.  Usually their interests are
	  as simple as crafting an exciting headline, but they can also veer into
	  contentious political ideologies or worldviews.

	  A <strong>special interest</strong> is a partial
	  feature of a whole situation that receieves privileged favoring.
	  Everyone has special interests to a certain
	  degree, but some can do a good job of keeping their special interests
	  from influencing their behavior. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The opposite of being swayed by special interests is in being <strong>
	    objective</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Special interests can be difficult to detect, and this secrecy makes them
	  more powerful.  In order to get the whole truth of a situation, we need
	  to try very hard to suppress the influence of our own special interests,
	  just as we need to identify the interests of where we hear the news.
