	  Polls and reports about polls are not the same.  Nor do they exist for the
	  same reasons.  Polls are conducted to gather certain facts, while reporting
	  must package and present information for a certain audience.  If the audience
	  does not have a strong scientific background, then reports on polls might
	  choose to downsplay subtle points of political science in favor of simplistic
	  or sensational assertions.  There is good and bad mixed in with this situation,
	  but in either case it means we must be careful when we read reports
	  about polls.

	  What we can say is that news organizations have <strong>special
	    interests</strong>.  This means that they are interested in a subset of
	  the whole <em>general</em> state-of-affairs.  Usually their interests are
	  as simple as crafting an exciting headline, but they can also veer into
	  contentious political ideologies or worldviews.

	  What effect could this ability to predict elections have on our political
	  process?  It is exciting to get early predictions -- but the early
	  forecasts can also cause problems for the voters.  Imagine that you are
	  waiting in line to cast your vote, and then you see on your phone that
	  your favored candidate has <em>already "lost"</em> according to the exit-polls.
	  Would you stay in line and cast your vote anyway?

          One of the most dramatic incidents of this early forecasting in
	  the presidential race was in the 1980 contest between Reagan and Carter.
	  NBC News predicted Reagan's victory at <strong>8:15pm EST</strong>, well before
	  the West Coast polling stations even closed for the day!  This was the
	  earliest forecast ever, and this incident sent a shockwave through the media.
	  Nowadays, news stations make a promise not to call a winner <em>before</em>
	  voting officially ends, since they do not want to depress voter turnout.

              There is no right or wrong answer to this question, and indeed there have
	      been many lawsuits from both sides of the issue.  On the one hand,
	      people should have a right to broadcast facts, but on the other hand,
	      people should be able to vote in an undisturbed environment.  The
	      difficulty with resolving this issue
	      seems to stem from the way in which voting is a deeply private affair,
	      while polling is a purely public act.

	  A <strong>special interest</strong> is a partial
	  feature of a whole situation that receieves privileged favoring.
	  Everyone has special interests to a certain
	  degree, but some can do a good job of keeping their special interests
	  from influencing their behavior. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The opposite of being swayed by special interests is in being <strong>
	    objective</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Special interests can be difficult to detect, and this secrecy makes them
	  more powerful.  In order to get the whole truth of a situation, we need
	  to try very hard to suppress the influence of our own special interests,
	  just as we need to identify the interests of where we hear the news.
