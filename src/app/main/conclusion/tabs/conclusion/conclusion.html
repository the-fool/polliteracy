	  Congratulations!  You just completed this learning module on poll literacy!
	  Now you are equipped to venture forth into the complicated, wild, and
	  exciting world of public polling!
	</p>
	<p>
	  After completing this module, you should now be able to:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	  Be able to identify the relation between between a poll's <strong>population</strong> size and its <strong>sample</strong>
	</li>
        <li>
	  Develop a sense for how <strong>sample bias</strong>
	  affects a poll's accuracy
	</li>
	<li>
	  Become familiar with a famous story of biased polling methods
	</li>
	<li>
	  Be able to mark whether a poll is of good <strong>quality</strong> rather than
	  just large in the sense of <strong>quantity</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
	  Be able to explain how it is that an <strong>unbiased</strong> small
	  poll is likely
	  <em>more accurate</em> than a <strong>biased</strong> large poll
	</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  You also had a hands-on lab to experience the importance of randomness!
	</p>
	<p>
	  Again -- congratulations!  Now go out there and read the polls!
