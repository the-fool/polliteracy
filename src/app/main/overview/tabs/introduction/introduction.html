	  Welcome to this learning module on poll literacy! Our goal is to get equipped
	  to tackle the wild world of public opinion polls with confidence, wisdom,
	  and critical analytical skills.  Polls are an important part of
	  modern-day political activity, and an ability to maneuver through
	  their terrain is increasingly important.
	  What are the mathematical foundations for polling science?
	  How do we judge whether a poll deserves our belief?
	  What should we look for when the news reports on polls?
	  How trusting should we be?
	  What common mistakes do people make when trying to understand what exactly
	  a poll says?
	</p>
	<p>
	  By the end of this module, you will be able to take a critical stance against
	  news reports of poll results, as well as understand the underlying methodology
	  for how those poll results came to be.  You will also understand some of the
	  most common reasons for why surpising upsets keep happening.
