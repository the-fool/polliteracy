	  Welcome to this learning module on poll literacy! Our goal is to get equipped
	  to tackle the wild world of public opinion polls with confidence, wisdom,
	  and critical analytical skills.  An ability to maneuver through
	  the present-day barrage of polls is becoming more and more important, as polls
	  take more of center stage in our political climate, become more
	  mathematically rigorous, and come under the sway of dishonest special
	  interest groups.
	</p>
	<p>
	  By the end of this module, you will be able to take a critical stance against
	  news reports of poll results, as well as understand the underlying methodology
	  for how those poll results came to be.
